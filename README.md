# TapCamp

**TapCamp** is an on-chain social app that gamifies making real-life connections. Mint your unique NFC tag, meet new people, earn tokens, and compete for the pot in a dynamic, ever-evolving social experience.

## Problem It Solves

TapCamp addresses the challenge of making meaningful real-life connections in an increasingly digital world. Traditional social apps often fail to facilitate genuine in-person interactions, leaving users isolated despite being "connected" online.

## Features

- **Facilitates Real-Life Connections:** Encourages face-to-face interactions by requiring in-person meetings to earn TPCP tokens.
- **Gamifies Socializing:** Turns meeting new people into a fun and competitive game.
- **Secure and Transparent:** Blockchain ensures transparency and security in social networking.
- **Maintains Liquidity:** Token burning mechanism helps maintain liquidity and stability of the token economy.
- **Incentivizes Participation:** Potential to earn a share of the pot motivates active participation.

## How It Works

1. **Mint Your NFC Tag:** Get onboarded into the app by minting your self-assigned unique NFC tag. A mint fee is collected into a pot on-chain.
2. **Register On-Chain:** Once your connekt tag is registered on-chain, you can start meeting people in real life with similar connekt tags.
3. **Earn TPCP Tokens:** When you connekt with a person, you get a random number of TPCP tokens.
4. **Complete the Cycle:** When the pot reaches its limit, the cycle is complete. The person with the highest number of tokens gets a share of the pot, and their tokens are burnt to maintain liquidity.
5. **Repeat:** The game continues with a new cycle.
 

### Usage

1. **Mint Your NFC Tag:** Follow the instructions in the app to mint your unique NFC tag.
2. **Start Connecting:** Use your connekt tag to meet new people and start earning TPCP tokens.
